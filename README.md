# DataAnalysis-Science
A repository containing projects for Data Analysis and Data Science. All projects will be done using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Below is a list of current projects in this repository
* Computation with Numpy and N-dimensional arrays
  - First major project using Numpy and learned how to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array,
    how to do linear algebra with NumPy and how to manipulate images as ndarrays.
* Data Visualization with Matplotlib-Programming Languages
  - Downloaded an excel file from Stack Overflow and used Matplotlib and Pandas to visualize and manipulate the data.
* Movie, budget and revenue using Seaborn and Scikit-learn
  - First major project using Seaborn and Scikit-learn. Used Seaborn to visualize the data with help from the Pandas
    library. Created a linear regression model to predict the revenue of a movie.
* College Major vs Salary Expectations
  - The project was done to practice basic data cleaning and processing. Using the cleaned data a few
    general questions were answered for example "which degrees have the highest starting salaries?".
